# README Generator
This application is a generator of a README.  It allows the user to enter information for their readme on the command line and then have a professional README file generated.  No longer does a user have to struggle with formating a README.  Now the user can spend their time with what really counts, developing new code.  

## Installation
The README Generator can be cloned from the repo located
